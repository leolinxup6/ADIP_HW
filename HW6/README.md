# Exercise 1
### Homomorphic filtering
> * Use homomorphic filtering to enhance the detail of `house512.raw`. Please use different parameters(rL, rH, D<sub>0</sub>,...*etc*).

# Exercise 2
### Filter in frequency domain
> * Using **ideal LPF** with D<sub>0</sub>=5, 25, 125 respectively to filter `aerialcity512.raw` in frequency domain. Show the filtered output images and their magnitude spectrum. Calculate their MSE and PSNR value with origin image.
> * Using **Gaussian HPF** with D<sub>0</sub>=5, 25, 125 respectively to filter `aerialcity512.raw` in frequency domain. Show the filtered output images and their magnitude spectrum. Calculate their MSE and PSNR value with origin image.
