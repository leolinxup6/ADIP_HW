# Exercise 1
### 2D-DFT
> * Write your own **DFT** subroutine(with origin shifted) and test on `rect256.raw`, `circle256.raw`, `square256.raw` and `square256_rotate.raw`. Show the output of both magnitude and phase spectra.
> * Compare the output from previous question with the output by using OpenCV build-in DFT function. Show the execution time and result images.
> * Write your own **IDFT** subroutine and test on DFT output from first problem. Show the result images and the corresponding with MSE and PSNR value.
>   **NOTE**:You should use contrast enhancement technique when showing your output.
